# Western Canada Learning Network LTI Provider  

This local plugin adds an LTI provider framework to a Moodle site. This LTI provider is different from the core Moodle LTI in that it allows providing Books and Pages. It does not collect user information or any consumer site data. The purpose is entirely to provide content seamlessly into any LMS which accepts LTI content.
